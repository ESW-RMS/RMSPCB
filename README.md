We are partnering with a community development NGO called IBEKA to develop a way to remotely monitor the performance of the small-scale hydropower ("micro-hydro") plants that they have helped build in numerous Indonesian communities. These plants increase access to clean electricity in remote regions, allowing villagers increased opportunities. However, it can be difficult to get a constant and reliable stream of plant performance data, which slows down the process of getting technical assistance if the generator experiences technical difficulties.

Our system will provide the needed service of long-term monitoring. At each generator, we will install a device that will take voltage and current readings from the generator and send them via LoRa radio to a receiver in a cell service area, which will then send the information to IBEKA's headquarters in Jakarta. From there the data will be processed and uploaded to a central database and website, where it will be available for use by IBEKA, villagers, and IBEKA's donors.
